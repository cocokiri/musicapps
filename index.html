            Play the Piano on your Keyboard (keys: ` | 1 | 2 | 3 ...). You can: <br /> <br />
            + shift sound slowly or with Octave jumps <br />
            + see the chords you're playing <br />
            + face the music <br /> <br />

            <h1><span>RealTime Pitch Detection and Visualization</span></h1>
            <img id="img1" src="./images/PitchVis.png" alt="This is me" />
            <a href="https://cocokiri.github.io/PitchVisualizer-Spectrogram/" target="
            _blank" class="button">P l a y</a>
            <p><b>JS</b> <br /> <br />
                I made this intuitive, realtime spectrogram because all other pitch detection and spectrogram
                products on web/mobile were horrible. <br /><br /> Eg bad mappings (<em>hello audacity</em>), dumb Signal Processing code (<em>why dafuq would I need autocorrelation for monophonics, Boris Smus?</em>)
                and were generally cluttered (<em>popular YIN algorithm -- 1200ms delay @ 70% accuracy. 1000 lines of C# for jack shit. No thanks</em>).
                <br /><br />
                You know it's bad when you see [frequency <-> note] mappings instead of translator functions (just logarithms, man).<br /><br />
                The core pitch detection algorithm is extremly accurate for single harmonic sounds and has almost no delay.
                I have to refactor the code tho...it's a mess.
                     <br /> <br />
                + Shows pitch and timbre exactly where it occurs in the spectrogram <br />
                + Gives you a strong sense of intervals, fluctations and musical relationships <br />
                + Even if tonedeaf, you see what's up and train your voice and ear. <br /> <br />

                Use your mouse to play with oscillator sounds. Other than most music web/mobile XPs I'm
                stricter with the mapping. This has the side-effect of actually learning something.

            Beneath are some Unity Experiments (C#). I made them to learn programming.

            <p><b>Unity 3D</b><br /><br />Same concept as the earlier 2D spaceshooter. Dodge X, shoot Y -- you know the spiel. The pitch controls change with time and are always
                part of the major scale. <br /> <br /> Image: <em> C# = left, B = shoot; D# = right</em> <br /><br />
                I demoed this game in San Francisco at the <em>Noisebridge 10-Year Anniversary</em> after being part of a game dev bootcamp there.

                You collect the colored triangles by playing their corresponding notes. The speed and width of the "player" depend on how consistent the pitch sounds</p>
